# 👋 Hi, I’m Kathryn Starkey  

Welcome to my data portfolio! I’m building skills as a **Data Support Analyst**, with projects that highlight SQL, Power BI, and cloud data platforms (Snowflake and Azure). My goal is to transform raw data into clear, actionable insights that support real business decision-making.

## 🔎 Featured Projects  


- 📂 [SQL Portfolio](https://github.com/kattanalytics/MySQL)  
  Hands-on SQL projects using datasets like Superstore Sales, Employees, and World.  

- 📊 [Power BI Dashboard](https://github.com/kattanalytics/SQL---Portfolio/tree/main/sales)      
  This Power BI dashboard visualizes sales performance using the Superstore dataset.
  While the dashboard itself is built directly on the dataset, the SQL queries in this project demonstrate how similar analysis could be performed at the query level.

- ☁️ [Snowflake Portfolio](https://github.com/kattanalytics/SQL---Portfolio/tree/main/snowflake)  
  Queries and results demonstrating SQL analysis in Snowflake, including sales trends, top products, and regional performance. Highlights skills in cloud data warehousing.
