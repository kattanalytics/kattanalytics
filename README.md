# Hi, I’m Kathryn Starkey  

I am a Data Professional with experience spanning both data engineering and data analytics. My work focuses on designing and supporting end-to-end data solutions — from building and troubleshooting data pipelines in Azure and Snowflake, to transforming raw data into actionable insights through SQL analysis and Power BI dashboards.

By blending engineering skills with analytical expertise, I ensure data is not only reliable and well-structured, but also meaningful for decision-making. My projects showcase hands-on experience in:

Data engineering: cloud storage integration, pipeline automation, and schema management.

Data analytics: SQL-based insights, business reporting, and Power BI dashboards.

Data support: diagnosing errors, validating data quality, and ensuring solutions run smoothly in production-like settings.

My goal is to continue developing as a Data Support Analyst while bridging the gap between engineering and analytics to deliver solutions that drive real business impact.
